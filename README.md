## Goals
I built this porject because the client wanted a website to check the weather

## Problems and solutions
A Problem that I encountered was that even after completing the css and HTML some elements would not work unless the Javascript was completed; because of this I had to go through a lot of trial and error.

## Completed Requirements
```
1. When the user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions and the city is added to the search history
2. When the user views the weather conditions they are presented with the city name, date and icon associated with weather conditions. They also see temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index.
3. When the user views the UV index, they are presented with a color that indicated varying color conditions
4. When the user views a city they are presented with a 5-day forecast
5. When the user clicks on a city in the search history they go to that weather conditions
